A database is a structured collection of data. It may be anything from a simple shopping list to a picture gallery or a place to hold the vast amounts of information in a corporate network.

### What is MySQL?

MySQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle that is based on structured query language (SQL).

MySQL is open source, flexible, high performance, secure, and easy to use.

### What is SQLite?

SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means lightweight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resources.

SQLite has the following noticeable features: self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, transactional.

### What is MongoDB?

MongoDB is an open-source NoSQL database management program used for large sets of distributed data.

Organizations can use Mongo DB for its ad-hoc queries, indexing, load balancing, aggregation, server-side execution and other features.
